*Abstract*
The project was to enable a user to generate a random poster with a random image, quote, and title. The user also had to be able to make their own poster with their own inputs. They had to be able to save posters - both randomly generated and user inputted - and they had to be able to view the saved posters.

*Overall*
What role do you typically play on a team? (If you answer, provide an example from this project)
I am usually the person who tries to make sure everyone works well together and gets what they need. I made sure that we took our breaks on this project. I set the timer and made sure that breaks were the first thing we talked about. I discussed with Hannah how I thought it would be best for both of our learning if we didn't divide and conquer but rather worked together at the same time with both of us throwing our ideas out there to see what we thought of them as a group.

What is your approach to working on a team? (In your answer, provide an example from this project)
We're all trying to get to the goal together. I like to talk to my group members and discuss how we want to work. Do we want to divide and conquor? Do we want to all work on the same thing at the same time. At this stage in our learning, I think all of us working together at the same time is probably best and I suggest that to my group mates. We did that for the IdeaBox project. Even when we get frustrated, we're all working towards the same goal and it's nice to remember that. 


*Technical*
What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?
We both googled things that we couldn't figure out on our own, we talked to both of our Rocks, and we got help from her partner, a front-end engineer.

You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
After googling and watching videos didn't work, I reached out to a friend of mine who has been a software engineer since the 90s. He was able to help us figure out why our methods weren't working. He didn't give us the answer, he guided us to where we needed to look to find it. 

*Reflection*
What is one technical takeaway from this project?
Personally, I need to go through the exercises from last week to really solidify the information in my mind. I feel like I get it when it's explained to me but trying to do it myself is an arduous process. 

Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?
I want to make sure that I lay out my project before I start it, how am I going to do the CSS? How am I going to do the HTML? How am I going to do the JS? I want to pseudocode it so that I have a roadmap to follow.
