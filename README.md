*Abstract*
The project was to enable a user to generate a random romance cover with a random image, title, and taglines. The user also had to be able to make their own romance cover with their own inputs. They had to be able to save covers - both randomly generated and user inputted - and they had to be able to view the saved covers.

*Overall*
What role do you typically play on a team? (If you answer, provide an example from this project)
I am usually the person who tries to make sure everyone works well together and gets what they need. I made sure that we took our breaks on this project and that we discussed what our goals were for each worktime - how long would we work, how far did we want to get, what scheduling issues did we have?

What is your approach to working on a team? (In your answer, provide an example from this project)
We're all trying to get to the goal together. I like to talk to my group members and discuss how we want to work. Do we want to divide and conquor? Do we want to all work on the same thing at the same time. At this stage in our learning, I think all of us working together at the same time is probably best and I suggest that to my partner.


*Technical*
What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?
We both googled things that we couldn't figure out on our own, we reached out to our cohort for help, and we reviewed class notes. 

You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
Google is my first choice and then I will ask someone in my cohort, my Rock, or my mentor. 

*Reflection*
What is one technical takeaway from this project?
I think I understand innerHTML and event listeners pretty well now. I also think that my understanding of the data model vs the DOM is pretty sound. 

Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?
I'm excited to start it. I think I know what I'm doing with the CSS and I have a much better idea of the JS. I think I want to concentrate on event listeners and functions.
