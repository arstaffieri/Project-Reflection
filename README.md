*Abstract*
The project was to enable a user to generate a random poster with a random image, quote, and title. The user also had to be able to make their own poster with their own inputs. They had to be able to save posters - both randomly generated and user inputted - and they had to be able to view the saved posters.

*Overall*
What role do you typically play on a team? (If you answer, provide an example from this project)
I am usually the person who tries to make sure everyone works well together and gets what they need. I made sure that we took our breaks on this project. I set the timer and made sure that breaks were the first thing we talked about. I discussed with Hannah how I thought it would be best for both of our learning if we didn't divide and conquer but rather worked together at the same time with both of us throwing our ideas out there to see what we thought of them as a group.


*Technical*
What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?
We both googled things that we couldn't figure out on our own, we talked to both of our Rocks, and we got help from her partner, a front-end engineer.

*Reflection*
What is one technical takeaway from this project?
Personally, I need to go through the exercises from last week to really solidify the information in my mind. I feel like I get it when it's explained to me but trying to do it myself is an arduous process.
